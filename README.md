# Arduino Debug Macros

This repository contains a few macros that can help debugging Arduino sketches. The repo was written with Visual Studio Code, so its structure follows the VSC organization. In particular, the code is in the *src* folder.

## Macros

The macros are defined in the *src/DebugMacros.h* header. In addition, a few parameters must be set in the *src/Parameters.h* header. For more details, see the corresponding files.

An example of how to use the macros is presented in the *src/src.ino* sketch.
